Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.  
(If you're looking for a WordPress framework, check out [Redux Framework](https://reduxframework.com/).)  

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live coding editing combined with a time travelling debugger](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools).  

You can use Redux together with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), or with any other view library.  
It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).

### **Developer Experience**  

I wrote Redux while working on my React Europe talk called [“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs). My goal was to create a state management library with minimal API but completely predictable behavior, so it is possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.
