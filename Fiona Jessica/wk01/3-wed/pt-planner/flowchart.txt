journey planning flowchart


Start

Given 3 lines: glenWaverly, alamein, sandringham
  The Alamein line has the following stops: Flinders Street, Richmond, East Richmond, Burnley, Hawthorn, and Glenferrie.
  The Glen Waverly line has the following stops: Flagstaff, Melbourne Central, Parliament, Richmond, Kooyong and Tooronga.
  The Sandringham line has the following stops: Southern Cross, Richmond, South Yarra, Prahran, and Windsor.

Get origin and destination station from user
find given origin & destination station from which line
find intersection from the 3 train lines

create user route

  if origin and destination station is located within same line
    find how many trips required: 1 trip
      trip no 1
        starting point: origin station
        end point: destination station

        find all station between starting point and end point, and added into user route
      then print user route including number of stops


  if origin and destination station is located in different line,
    find how many trips required: 2 trips
      trip no 1
        starting point: origin station
        end point: intersection station

        find all station between starting point and end point, and added into user route

      trip no 2
        starting point: end point of trip no 1
        end point: destination station

        find all station between starting point and end point, and added into user route

      combined user route from trip no 1 and trip no 2
      then print combined user route including number of stops


  if origin equal to intersection point (TBD)



End :( (not quite)

keyword: get, given, set, create, insert, go to, find, combined, if, else



    second draft:
    go to origin station lines
    set origin station as a starting point of trip no 1 and use intersection station as an end point of trip no 1
    go to destination station line
    set end point of trip no 1 as a starting point of trip no 2
    and use destination station as an end point of trip no 2



    first draft:
    then use intersection station as a temporary stop station,
    then change line from the temp stop station to destination station's line,
    then travel to destination station from the
















create
